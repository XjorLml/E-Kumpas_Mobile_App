🎉 Introducing the eKumpas Mobile App - Beta Release (v1.0.0-beta) 🎉

We're excited to announce the beta release of eKumpas, a Flutter-based mobile application that translates text into Sign Language using immersive animations! This app is designed to help bridge communication barriers for the deaf and hard of hearing community, making text-based communication more accessible and engaging.

🚀 Key Features:

🔠 Text to Sign Language Translation: Convert any text into Sign Language and watch it come to life through animated gestures.
🎥 Smooth Animations: The sign translations are displayed in clean, intuitive animations to help users easily follow and understand the signs.
🌐 Offline and Online Functionality: Whether you're connected to the internet or not, the app ensures you're never left without sign language support.
📱 User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, making the app accessible to users of all ages.
We are still in the beta phase, so your feedback is incredibly valuable to us. Feel free to report any issues or suggestions to help us improve the app before the official release.
